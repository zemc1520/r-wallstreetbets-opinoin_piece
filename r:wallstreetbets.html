	<h2>What happened to Gamestop that caused financial institutions to lose billions?</h2>

	<article>
		<p>
			How successful are you at predicting the stock market? Better yet, do you think you could manipulate the stock market? Individually, both of these tasks are extremely difficult, however, just as a hedge fund uses collective capital to trade and manipulate the market so can the public sector. On January 22, 2021, r/wallstreetbets collectively short squeezed the stock of Gamestop, AMC, and Build-A-Bear causing Melvin Capital to lose billions of dollars. In an effort to stop financial institutions from hemorrhaging money Robinhood restricted trade of the stock before the market closed. This type of arbitrary regulation is ridiculous and will be explored throughout the rest of the article. 
		</p>
		<p>
			For starters, let's explore exactly what a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze">short squeeze</a> is. In the example of r/wallstreetbets, they steadily bought Gamestop stock until their stock capital was equitable (enough stock was bought). Then on January 22<sup>nd</sup>, they began to offload their stock shares at below market value (essentially tanking the stock). This forced many other gamestop holders, like hedge funds, to sell their short positions which continued to over saturate the market. Then r/wallstreetbets collectively created demand for the stock directly after it tanked causing the once undervalued stock to become overvalued. Simply, r/wallstreetbets collectively forced the market to undervalue the stock by rapidly offloading their shares and then once bigger hedge funds sold their stock they created demand which caused the stock to rise. Overall, these financial institutions lost billions by selling a strong stock disguised by r/wallstreetbets at an inferior price.

			Furthermore, I do not believe that financial institutions or day trading apps, like Robinhood, should be allowed to restrict market manipulation from the public sector and protect private corporations. From a risk perspective (for the stock market), it is illogical to be more fearful of anti-elite populist outrage groups manipulating the stock market than private hedge funds who manipulate the market on a daily basis. This is for a few reasons. One, hedge funds have billions of dollars in capital funds to use to manipulate the market in their favor. Two, financial institutions are way more stable than online communities for logistical, communicative, and structural purposes. It is extremely astonishing for an online community of thousands to supplement their personal funds for the benefit of the group, even if they expect financial returns. Organizations at this scale require excellent communication from across group members. For these reasons, I believe that regulation should not be enacted from the perspective of market risk, there are simply more potential risks from our current institutions than online communities.

			Lastly, I believe that the action Robinhood took against r/wallstreetbets is reprehensible for the implications it leaves for future powerful online communities, to regulate and disbar others who have differing opinions. Robinhoodâ€™s action to deny Gamestock trades on their app before market close showed their clear motivation to protect multi-billion dollar financial institutions over the will of the people. For these specific reasons there should not be regulation limits on collective user engagement nor should we give more power to social media platforms to regulate and moderate content/platform experiences. Social media is unique in that the power it has on real world events is correlated to the will of the people. Currently, social media platforms have too much power to regulate and moderate content for their own motivations. We as the public, need to protect our freedom and exercise power for our best interest, just like the private sector.

			Overall, the events that transpired on wall street influenced by r/wallstreetbets is a tremendous example of the power that a collective union can have. While there are concerns that the public may act maliciously, I believe the will of the people is an important perspective to consider when making regulation. Especially, when you are considering regulating those people. Ultimately, this is an extremely unique event that caused our society to halt and ponder questions about unized power vs government and or corporate power.
